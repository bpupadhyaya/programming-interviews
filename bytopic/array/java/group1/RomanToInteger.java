// Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.
//
// Symbol       Value
// I             1
// V             5
// X             10
// L             50
// C             100
// D             500
// M             1000
// For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II.
// The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.
// Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead,
// the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to
// the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:
// I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.
// X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.
// C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
// Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.
// Example:
// Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
// Output: 1994
// Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

// Intuition:
// The key intuition lies in the fact that in Roman numerals, when a smaller value appears before a larger value, it represents
// subtraction, while when a smaller value appears after or equal to a larger value, it represents addition.
//
// Explanation:
// 1. The unordered map m is created and initialized with mappings between Roman numeral characters and their corresponding integer
// values. For example, 'I' is mapped to 1, 'V' to 5, 'X' to 10, and so on.
// 2. The variable ans is initialized to 0. This variable will accumulate the final integer value of the Roman numeral string.
// 3. The for loop iterates over each character in the input string s.
// For the example "IX":
// -When i is 0, the current character s[i] is 'I'. Since there is a next character ('X'), and the value of 'I' (1) is less than
// the value of 'X' (10), the condition m[s[i]] < m[s[i+1]] is true. In this case, we subtract the value of the current character
// from ans.
// ans -= m[s[i]];
// ans -= m['I'];
// ans -= 1;
// ans becomes -1.
// -When i is 1, the current character s[i] is 'X'. This is the last character in the string, so there is no next character to
// compare. Since there is no next character, we don't need to evaluate the condition. In this case, we add the value of the
// current character to ans.
// ans += m[s[i]];
// ans += m['X'];
// ans += 10;
// ans becomes 9.
// For the example "XI":
// -When i is 0, the current character s[i] is 'X'. Since there is a next character ('I'), and the value of 'X' (10) is greater
// than the value of 'I' (1), the condition m[s[i]] < m[s[i+1]] is false. In this case, we add the value of the current character
// to ans.
// ans += m[s[i]];
// ans += m['X'];
// ans += 10;
// ans becomes 10.
// -When i is 1, the current character s[i] is 'I'. This is the last character in the string, so there is no next character to
// compare. Since there is no next character, we don't need to evaluate the condition. In this case, we add the value of the
// current character to ans.
// ans += m[s[i]];
// ans += m['I'];
// ans += 1;
// ans becomes 11.
// 4. After the for loop, the accumulated value in ans represents the integer conversion of the Roman numeral string, and it is
// returned as the result.
