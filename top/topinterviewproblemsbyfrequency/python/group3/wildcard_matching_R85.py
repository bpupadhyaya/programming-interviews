"""
Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement wildcard pattern matching with support for '?' and '*' where:

'?' Matches any single character.
'*' Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence).
The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

Example 1:
Input: s = "aa", p = "a"
Output: false
Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".

Example 2:
Input: s = "aa", p = "*"
Output: true
Explanation: '*' matches any sequence.

Constraints:
0 <= s.length, p.length <= 2000
s contains only lowercase English letters.
p contains only lowercase English letters, '?' or '*'.
