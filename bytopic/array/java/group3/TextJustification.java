// Given an array of strings words and a width maxWidth, format the text such that each line has exactly maxWidth characters and
// is fully (left and right) justified.
// You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces ' ' when
// necessary so that each line has exactly maxWidth characters.
// Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide
// evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.
// For the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.
// Note:
// A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
// Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed maxWidth.
// The input array words contains at least one word.
// Example:
// Input: words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."], maxWidth = 16
// Output:
// [
//    "This    is    an",
//    "example  of text",
//    "justification.  "
// ]

// Logic : Modulo-based Space Distribution
// To solve the "Text Justification" problem using this approach, we pack words into each line using a greedy strategy.
// We then distribute spaces among the words on each line, using modulo arithmetic to decide where to place the extra spaces.
//
// Key Data Structures:
// List: To store the current words for a line and the result.
//
// Steps:
// 1. Initialization:
// -We start by initializing empty lists for the result and the current line words.
// -A counter is also initialized to keep track of the total length of words in the current line.
// 2. Processing Each Word:
// -For each word, we check if adding the next word to the current line would make it exceed the maximum width.
// -If it does, we proceed to justify the current line. This involves distributing spaces among the words. The modulo arithmetic
// is handy here, ensuring that extra spaces are evenly spread among the words.
// -Once the line is justified, we reset the lists and counter for the next line.
// -A special case is the last line, where we simply left-justify the words.
// 3. Wrap-up:
// Once all the words are processed and lines are justified, we return the result list.
//
// Example:
// Given the words = ["This", "is", "an", "example"] and maxWidth = 16:
// The word "This" is added to the current line.
// The word "is" is added to the current line.
// The word "an" is added to the current line, completing it with the string "This is an".
// The word "example" starts a new line.
// Complexity:
// Time Complexity ~ O(n), where n is the number of words.
// Space Complexity ~ O(nÃ—m), where n is the number of words and m is the average length of the words.
