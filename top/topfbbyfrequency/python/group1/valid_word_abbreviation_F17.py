"""
A string can be abbreviated by replacing any number of non-adjacent, non-empty substrings with their lengths.
The lengths should not have leading zeros.
For example, a string such as "substitution" could be abbreviated as (but not limited to):
"s10n" ("s ubstitutio n")
"sub4u4" ("sub stit u tion")
"12" ("substitution")
"su3i1u2on" ("su bst i t u ti on")
"substitution" (no substrings replaced)
The following are not valid abbreviations:
"s55n" ("s ubsti tutio n", the replaced substrings are adjacent)
"s010n" (has leading zeros)
"s0ubstitution" (replaces an empty substring)
Given a string word and an abbreviation abbr, return whether the string matches the given abbreviation.
A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.

Sample 1:
Input: word = "internationalization", abbr = "i12iz4n"
Output: true
Explanation: The word "internationalization" can be abbreviated as "i12iz4n" ("i nternational iz atio n").

Constraints:
1 <= word.length <= 20
word consists of only lowercase English letters.
1 <= abbr.length <= 10
abbr consists of lowercase English letters and digits.
All the integers in abbr will fit in a 32-bit integer.
