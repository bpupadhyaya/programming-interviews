alp: Order Management : Java :
1. Given an array of n numbers and a positive integer k. The problem is to find k numbers with most
occurrences, i.e., the top k numbers having the maximum frequency. If two numbers have the same frequency
then the larger number should be given preference. The numbers should be displayed in decreasing order of
 their frequencies. It is assumed that the array consists of k numbers with most occurrences.
 Input: arr[] = {3, 1, 4,4, 4, 5, 2, 6, 1, 1}, k = 2 Output: 4 1

2. We are given an array consisting of n integers and an integer k. We need to find the minimum range in
array [l, r] (both l and r are inclusive) such that there are exactly k different numbers. Examples:
Input : arr[] = { 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5} k = 3 Output : 5 7 Input : arr[] = { 1, 2, 2, 3} k = 2 Output : 0 1
