// Write a function that takes the binary representation of an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it
// has (also known as the Hamming weight).
// Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given
// as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation
// is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
//In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in Example 3, the input
// represents the signed integer. -3.
// Example:
// Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
// Output: 3
// Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.
